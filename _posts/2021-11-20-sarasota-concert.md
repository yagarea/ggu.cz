Few weeks ago I have met awesome folks from the mathematical part of MatFyz and
found out about band [Sarasota](https://bandzone.cz/sarasota), punk-jazz band by guys
from algebraic department. To my luck they are concerting 25.11. in Prague. So If you 
are in mood for some live music do not miss out on them!
