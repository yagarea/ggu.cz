description: Multitool for processing Czech public transport data
---

A collection of software for reading and analysing Czech public transport data,
including converting JDF and CZPTT files to GTFS, matching stops to OSM nodes
and scraping real-time positions.

Currently some parts are publicly deployed here: [A web app displaying
statistics on delays](https://rt.jr.ggu.cz/) and [a conversion of CIS JŘ data
to GTFS](https://data.jr.ggu.cz/).
